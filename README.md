MLB fantasy predictions for the 2023 season
## Batter Rankings [here](HitterRankings.csv)

In this exploration I will use metrics and advanced statistics in order to predict the fantasy statistics of MLB players in the 2023 season. I have utilized multiple datasets from baseball savant (https://baseballsavant.mlb.com) and Razzball (https://razzball.com/) in order to complete this analysis. Due to the fact that this model utilizes primarily metrics and not true results, the predicitons will be biased towards players with advanced "tools", such as exit velocity and strikeout rate. Therefore the predicitions will likely represent the true ceiling of each player, with regression likely. The primary data was constructed by taking metrics and advanced statistics from 2018-2021 and per game fantasy scores from 2019-2022 for qualified batters. The "year" column represents the year that the fantasy average occurred, and the metrics in each row are representative of the year prior to what the data indicates. This is done in order to utilize metrics and statistics from 2022 in order to predict fantasy points in 2023. The model will be created to predict fantasy points per game (hitters) or fantasy points per inning pitched (pitchers). The data will be preprocessed and applied to multiple types of regression models to obtain the model and parameters with the most accurate predictions. Once the model is complete and is able to effectively predict the fantasy score per game, I will apply predictions for number of games played / innings pitched in 2023 to compute an entire season prediction. Predictions for games played / innings pitched will be taken from Razzball. Team factors will also be applied to account for the differentiating results in different ballparks. Pitcher rankings are incoming!
