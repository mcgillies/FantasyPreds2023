MLB fantasy predictions for the 2023 season

In this exploration I will use metrics and advanced statistics in order to predict the fantasy statistics of MLB players in the 2023 season. I have utilized multiple datasets from baseball savant (https://baseballsavant.mlb.com) and Razzball (https://razzball.com/) in order to complete this analysis. The primary data was constructed by taking metrics and advanced statistics from 2018-2021 and per game fantasy scores from 2019-2022 for qualified batters. The "year" column represents the year that the fantasy average occurred, and the metrics in each row are representative of the year prior to what the data indicates. This is done in order to utilize metrics and statistics from 2022 in order to predict fantasy points in 2023. Once the model is complete and is able to effectively predict the fantasy score per game, I will apply predictions for number of games played in 2023 to compute an entire season prediction. Games played in 2023 will simply be calculated as the average games played per season from 2018-2022 (with the 2020 season normalized to a 162 game season. Team factors will also be applied to account for the differentiating results in different ballparks. Pitcher rankings are incoming!

##### Note: These rankings should not be used exactly to draft, as they are heavily based on metrics and quite biased towards certain skillsets. I would recommend using these rankings as a basis for players you should draft above/below ADP.
